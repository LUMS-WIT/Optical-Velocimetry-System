# Optical Velocimetry System

A **low-cost, vision-based flow sensor** for real-time surface velocity and discharge estimation in open channel water bodies such as rivers, canals, and streams. This system leverages optical flow techniques and onboard computing to enable **autonomous, contactless discharge measurement**, especially useful in unstructured or hazardous environments.

---

## Project Overview

This system was developed as a research prototype to address the limitations of conventional flow measurement methods, particularly in sites where physical access is difficult or unsafe. It uses a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to capture surface flow, applies the **Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm** to track particle motion, and computes discharge based on real-world calibration.

## Features

- **Optical Flow Tracking:** Uses Lucas-Kanade method to track water surface motion.
- **Real-time Velocity & Discharge Calculation**
- **Touchscreen GUI:** Built with `Tkinter`, optimized for Raspberry Pi touchscreen.
- **Onboard Storage:** Saves processed videos and CSV outputs locally.
- **No Internet Required:** Fully standalone device.
- **Portable & Weather-proof Casing:** Acrylic laser-cut enclosure for field use.

## Hardware Used

- Raspberry Pi 4B
- Camera Module (IR/Standard)
- 7-inch Capacitive Touchscreen LCD
- Acrylic case (laser cut & custom-fabricated)
- Power Bank (for field deployment)

## How It Works

1. **Camera Setup:** Mount above water surface using builtin infrastructure.
2. **Capture Video:** GUI allows 15-second recording at 30 FPS.
3. **Run Optical Flow:** Tracks features frame-to-frame using Lucas-Kanade method.
4. **Compute Velocity:** Converts pixel movement to ft/sec using real-world calibration.
5. **Calculate Discharge:** Uses user-input width & depth to compute cusec values.
